Changes in 0.7.5

In addition to varous bug fixes, the main difference between 0.7.4 and 0.7.5 is
an update to how template matching is parallelized. Rather than splitting the 
input tomogram by the number of cores, an input tilesize is given. The tilesize
is essentially target size of the tile to be spliced back into the output maps.
The actual extraction size is tilesize + template size, rounded down to 
generate equally sized tiles. Parallelization is then between tiles and angles.

This has several practical effects. The main one is that computation time and
number of cores scales nearly linearly. The second is that you can tune the 
tilesize to fit the memory on your system; assume ~5x the tilesize. While 
larger tilesizes have fewer computations due to a smaller percentage of 
calculations going towards the overlap regions, large tiles may be more costly
to compute with; you may wish to tune this for balance but 192 can be a good
starting point.
